## What is cancer?

Cancer is the body’s expression of immortality. You may have heard of cancer in the news, or through conversations with friends, or you may be unlucky enough to have heard of cancer through a family member having the disease. 

When you cut your finger or grazed your elbow, healthy cells signal to each other to grow and divide. When there is no more space for the healthy cells to fill, the cells signal to each other to stop dividing. Signals are passed between cells by molecules on the surface (membrane) of the cell. The signals help the cell to stay in the right place; any cells that do not recognise their neighbouring cell’s molecules undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death). 

Bodily cells function normally until there is a mutation of the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) of a gene within the nucleus that instructs the cell to cease or alter its normal function. One of the functions of a gene is to regulate how often and how much the cell divides. If this function ceases or is altered, then the cell may continue to divide at an unstoppable rate. Cancer results from an uncontrolled proliferation of cells in your body, and may lead to a tumour, which is a mass of misfunctioning cells. The tumour may then spread if cancerous cells metastasise from the mass.

## What are the treatments?

For hundreds of years, even since the ancient Egyptians, physicians have been confounded by the origins of cancer and how to rid it of the body. William Halsted, a radical 19th century surgeon, pioneered extensive removal of bodily tissue in an attempt to not only detach the original tumour but also avoid cancer cells reaching further into the body. Later, in 1896, Emil Grubbe used radiation to kill cancerous cells, the side effect was that it also killed healthy cells. Radiation is still used as a treatment because cancer cells do not have the ability to repair, but healthy cells do. Fast-forward into the 1940s, during the outbreak of World War Two, one of the first chemotherapy drugs, nitrogen mustard, was used to treat lymphoma. This too has side effects, chemotherapy drugs target rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer, but the body also has rapidly-dividing healthy cells such as the skin and hair. Chemotherapy is cytotoxic: the drug kills cancer cells.

Since the late 20th century, the focus of research has been on targeted therapies; this form of treatment is cytostatic: the drug blocks the tumour cell proliferation. Targeted therapies act on specific molecular targets presenting on the surface of a cell membrane.
